# Bamazon

In this homework assignment, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills and Node.js.

bamazon database has a products table that includes the following fields: 
 1. item_id (unique id for each product)
  2. product_name (Name of the product)
  3. department_name
  4. price (cost to customer)
  5. stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

I have included 10 different items in the database saved in mySQL.

**This is how you can run the application.**

Run bamazonCustomer.js in node.  

It will then list items with:

1. Unique ID for each product.
2. Name of product
3. Department
4. Price
5. Quantity in stock

Then you will be prompted two messages.

1. What ID of the product do you like to buy?
2. How many would you like to buy?

Input the ID and QTY and the app will deduct from inventory and give you the total cost of the items you bought.
