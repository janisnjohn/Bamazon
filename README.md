# Bamazon

bamazon database has a products table that includes the following fields: 
item_id (unique id for each product), 
product_name (Name of the product),
department_name
price (cost to customer)
stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

I have included 10 different items in the database saved in mySQL.

**How to run the application**
run bamazonCustomer.js in node.  

It will list of items with :

1. Unique ID for each product.
2. Name of product
3. Department
4. Price
5. Quantity in stock

Then you will be prompted two messages.

1. What ID of the product do you like to buy?
2. How many would you like to buy?

Input the ID and QTY and the app will deduct from inventory and give you the total cost of the items you bought.
